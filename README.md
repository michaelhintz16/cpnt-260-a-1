this is the image gallery and social icons assignment
i added a linke when you click on gallery to go to my image gallery that i created i dident know if we had to make one or not and i did it in codepen 
the images i used were strickly just copy and past from my browser.
The troubles i had were trying to get my image gallery to be on a page of its own. 






Atributes i used lorem picsum for the images 
and the other images i used on the front page are from my browser.
